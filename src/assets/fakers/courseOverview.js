    <p>Have you ever wanted to create a Web application&nbsp;but didn't know where to start?&nbsp;Have you previously tried to learn Django&nbsp;but got&nbsp;fed up with incomplete YouTube videos and poorly written tutorials? Or are you looking to move your code from Django 1 to Django 2?</p><p><strong>THEN&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COURSE&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;YOU!</strong></p><p>In my Django course, I will walk you through the Django web framework from beginning to end!&nbsp;I'm a self-taught programmer so I know what it feels like to start from scratch. I care about your learning, but even more importantly...&nbsp;<strong>I&nbsp;care about you</strong>!&nbsp;
    </p><p><strong>What is Django?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Django is&nbsp;an open-source web framework that is written in Python. It was created about twelve years ago, but in April 2019 Django 2.2 was released with a <strong>whole new set of features and capabilities</strong>!&nbsp;</p><p>Django is an amazing framework for web developers because it&nbsp;provides the&nbsp;infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact&nbsp;forms, file uploads, and more. Instead of creating all of&nbsp;these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework and&nbsp;utilize these components that are already built, and focus your time on developing your web app instead.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're going to be working with Python, especially for web applications or web design, you'll want to learn the&nbsp;Django framework. It will <strong>save you a ton of time</strong>!&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Contents and Overview</strong>
    </p><p>I believe we learn best by doing. So, throughout this course you'll be presented with coding quizzes and challenges in order for&nbsp;you to&nbsp;<strong>test what you just learned</strong>. This format will allow you to actually learn Django&nbsp;and not just follow along like a robot ;)</p><p>We will use Python in this course, so if you have never used Python before, we will&nbsp;start with a python refresher&nbsp;to get you up to speed (no other python experience required).&nbsp;</p><p>We will then dive into making three complete websites:&nbsp;</p><p>1 - <strong>Word-Counting&nbsp;Website</strong>: A simple website to count the most frequently used words in a piece of text. You will learn how to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Install Django</p></li><li><p>Create a new project</p></li><li><p>Work with Django's URL&nbsp;routing&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Submit and handle HTML&nbsp;form data</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>2 - <strong>Personal Portfolio</strong>:&nbsp;Create your own portfolio to show to potential employers showing off your resume, previous projects, and a fully functional blog. You will learn how to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Add apps to your project</p></li><li><p>Work with databases including SQLite and Postgres</p></li><li><p>Access the admin panel</p></li><li><p>Create super users&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create virtual environments&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Make a responsive website with Bootstrap 4</p></li><li><p>Work with static and media files&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3 - <strong>Product Hunt Clone</strong>: Make a simplified version of the awesome website to share new tech products. You will learn how to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Work with the authentication system (sign up, login, logout)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Reuse templates</p></li><li><p>Create model relationships</p></li><li><p>Add icons via Iconic</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>I will also walk you through Git, which is an awesome tool for developers that allows you to create&nbsp;multiple versions of your code. I'll explain why this is useful and help you understand why you should use it.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, I will show you how to take the projects that you made in this course and publish them live on the web through a Virtual Private Server. Like I&nbsp;said, I will take you from the <strong>very beginning to the very end</strong>!&nbsp;</p><p>Course material is regularly refreshed to include all of the newest updates and information, and since youâ€™re granted lifetime access upon registering, you can rely on this course to keep your Django&nbsp;skills on the cutting edge. Additionally, I&nbsp;have made this course&nbsp;<strong>downloadable</strong>, so you can work through the class offline, making it as&nbsp;<strong>convenient&nbsp;</strong>as possible for you! Most instructors won't allow this, but I want you to be able to enjoy this course in whichever way is best for you&nbsp;:)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Don't waste your time scouring the internet and trying to piece together how to learn Django on your own.&nbsp;<strong>Invest in yourself</strong>, and allow me to teach you Django while having fun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don't take my word for it. See what my other students are saying!&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><em>"Amazing course to get into Django and web development! Nick is really engaging and enthusiastic and a joy to learn from!!
