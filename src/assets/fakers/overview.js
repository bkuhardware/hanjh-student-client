    <p>If you're looking to get started building full-stack&nbsp;applications with Vue JS&nbsp;and Firebase, then look no further. In this course&nbsp;I'll take you from novice to ninja in Vue JS, starting out with the very basics of VueJS&nbsp;and then moving on towards creating fully-fledged VueJS applications.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll spend a whole chapter learning about the Vue Router&nbsp;-&nbsp;and how to create SPA's (single page applications) using it -&nbsp;as well as exploring how to use&nbsp;the Vue CLI to get up and running quickly when creating Vue applications.</p><p>I'll also teach you how to&nbsp;use&nbsp;Firebase, an online, free&nbsp;service provided by Google which acts as a very feature-rich, fully-fledged&nbsp;back-end to our applications. We'll learn how to use Firebase to store and retrieve data to and from&nbsp;a NoSQL database called Firestore, as well as authenticate our app's users with the Firebase Auth service, We'll also take a peak at Firebase Cloud Functions (which allow us to run server-side&nbsp;JavaScript code in a Node.js environment), as well as deploying all of our applications to Firebase hosting.</p><p>There's a crazy amount to cover, but by the end of this course you'll be in a position to create full-stack web applications (complete with user authentication) using Vue&nbsp;JS&nbsp;and Firebase!</p><p><strong>I'm also know as The Net Ninja on YouTube</strong></p><p>...With around 200,000 subscribers and nearly 1000 free web development tutorials. So feel free to check out my teaching style and reviews before you buy my course :).</p><p>This course is built with Vue 2.x, and will be added to with extra sections in the future.</p>
